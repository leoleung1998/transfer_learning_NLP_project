# Transfer Learning with NLP Tensorflow hub

In this project, I have used pretrainned models from Tensorflow hub with tf.kear for text classification and visualise the performace using TensorBoard.

["Quora Insincere Questions Classification"](https://www.kaggle.com/c/quora-insincere-questions-classification/data) from kaggle will be used and our models will be trained to detect if the questions asked on Quora is sincere or not.

Five pre-trained models were used as stated below:
1. [gnews-swivel-20dim](https://tfhub.dev/google/tf2-preview/gnews-swivel-20dim/1)
2. [nnlm-en-dim50](https://tfhub.dev/google/tf2-preview/nnlm-en-dim50/1)
3. [nnlm-en-dim128](https://tfhub.dev/google/tf2-preview/nnlm-en-dim128/1)
4. [universal-sentence-encoder](https://tfhub.dev/google/universal-sentence-encoder/4)
5. [universal-sentence-encoder-large](https://tfhub.dev/google/universal-sentence-encoder-large/5)

To run the notebook, please make a copy on Google Colab first
